# TGA-Improved-Hard-Mod

TGA Improved Hard Mod builds on the original TGA Hard Mod by coolCat5G, introducing targeted tweaks across various levels for a refreshed challenge. Some areas ramp up difficulty with tougher enemies or scarcer resources, while others streamline gameplay for better flow and accessibility.

## Aggressive Enemy Scaling
• Late-game AI boosted 8-300% (speeds, timers, detection ranges)
• Optimized bytecode maintains 60+ FPS, but the latest game sessions may still cause lag
• Randomized starting conditions (power 50-85%) force adaptation

## Original Feel Preserved
• Pure AI behavior tweaks, no visual/mechanic overhauls
• Surgical code optimizations only
• Maintains FNAF tension & core challenge loop
